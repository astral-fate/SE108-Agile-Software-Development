        <h2>Key Concepts from Unit 1</h2>

        <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Traditional Waterfall Model</h3>
            <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework describing the phases of software creation (PDF slide 4). The traditional <strong>Waterfall Model</strong> is a sequential SDLC where each phase must be completed before the next begins (PDF slide 5):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Requirement Gathering</li>
                <li>System Analysis</li>
                <li>Coding</li>
                <li>Testing</li>
                <li>Implementation</li>
                <li>Operations & Maintenance</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This linear flow makes it rigid and difficult to handle changes once a phase is finished (PDF slides 5, 7).</p>
        </div>

         <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>What is Agile Development?</h3>
            <p>Agile is an umbrella term for software development processes (PDF slide 6) based on (PDF slide 10):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iterative:</strong> Development occurs in repeating cycles (iterations). (PDF slide 7)</li>
                <li><strong>Incremental:</strong> Software is built and delivered in functional pieces (increments). (PDF slide 7)</li>
                <li><strong>Self-organizing:</strong> Teams manage their own work to achieve goals, with best designs emerging from them. (PDF slide 10, 13)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change, unlike rigid traditional methods.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>Agile vs. Traditional Methods: Handling Constraints</h3>
             <p>A fundamental difference lies in how they approach project constraints (Scope/Functionality, Time, Resources) (PDF slide 8):</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Traditional (Waterfall):</strong> Features/Functionality are usually <strong>Fixed</strong> upfront. <strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Resources</strong> are flexible (often leading to delays/overruns to deliver the fixed scope).</li>
                 <li><strong>Agile:</strong> <strong>Time</strong> (iterations) and <strong>Resources</strong> (team size) are often <strong>Fixed</strong>. <strong>Functionality</strong> is flexible and evolves based on priority and feedback, delivering the most valuable features within the fixed constraints.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Agile prioritizes delivering value within predictable timeboxes, while Traditional aims for a fixed scope, often sacrificing time/budget predictability.</p>
         </div>

        <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>The Agile Manifesto: Core Values</h3>
             <p>The Manifesto defines four core values, stating that while items on the right have value, those on the left are valued more (PDF slide 9):</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li>
                 <li><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation (referred to as "Working Product" in PDF slide 9)</li>
                 <li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li>
                 <li><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</li>
             </ul>
             <p>This shifts focus to people, functional output, partnership, and adaptability.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>Key Agile Principles (Selected)</h3>
            <p>Supporting the values are 12 principles. Important ones include (PDF slides 11-13):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highest priority is customer satisfaction through <strong>early and continuous delivery</strong> of valuable software.</li>
                <li><strong>Welcome changing requirements</strong>, even late. Agile processes harness change for customer advantage.</li>
                <li>Deliver <strong>working software frequently</strong> (weeks to months, shorter timescale preferred).</li>
                <li>Business people and developers must <strong>work together daily</strong>.</li>
                <li>Build projects around <strong>motivated individuals</strong>, providing support and trusting them.</li>
                <li>Most efficient communication is <strong>face-to-face conversation</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Working software</strong> is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                <li>Promote <strong>sustainable development</strong> pace.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>—maximizing work not done—is essential.</li>
                <li>Best designs emerge from <strong>self-organizing teams</strong>.</li>
             </ul>
        </div>

         <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>Agile Characteristics</h3>
            <p>Agile development processes typically exhibit the following characteristics (PDF slide 14):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Process broken into smaller parts.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative:</strong> Development in short cycles for fast verification/correction.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Iteration cycles are fixed (1-6 weeks).</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Flexible with possible emergent risks.</li>
                <li><strong>People-oriented:</strong> Focus on individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> Communicative working style.</li>
             </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-block">
            <h3>Advantages of Agile</h3>
             <p>Key benefits of adopting Agile (PDF slides 15-16):</p>
             <ul>
                 <li><strong>Early Realization of Value:</strong> Incremental nature means functional product parts are available early.</li>
                 <li><strong>Visibility & Early Issue Identification:</strong> Frequent releases make product visible, helping identify issues sooner.</li>
                 <li><strong>Adaptability to Change:</strong> Easier to accept and respond to changes.</li>
                 <li><strong>Increased Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Through collaboration and frequent delivery.</li>
                 <li><strong>Producing the Right Product:</strong> Iterative process and feedback ensure alignment with needs.</li>

        {
            question: "Compare and contrast the Traditional Waterfall Model with Agile methodologies, focusing on how they handle project constraints (Scope, Time, Resources).",
            answer: `
                <p>The key difference between the Traditional Waterfall Model and Agile methodologies lies in their approach to managing project constraints: Scope (Functionality/Features), Time (Schedule), and Resources (Budget/Team Size).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traditional (Waterfall):</strong> In the Waterfall model, the <strong>Scope/Functionality</strong> is typically <strong>Fixed</strong> upfront, defined in detail before development begins. This fixed scope is resistant to change once phases are completed. Consequently, <strong>Time</strong> and <strong>Resources</strong> become the flexible variables, often extending to accommodate the original fixed scope if issues or changes arise. (Based on PDF slides 5, 8)</li>
                    <li><strong>Agile:</strong> Agile methodologies often treat <strong>Time</strong> (via fixed-length iterations/sprints) and <strong>Resources</strong> (via stable teams) as relatively <strong>Fixed</strong> constraints. The <strong>Scope/Functionality</strong> then becomes the flexible variable. The team prioritizes and delivers the most valuable features within the fixed time and budget, allowing requirements to evolve based on feedback. (Based on PDF slide 8)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In summary, Waterfall aims to deliver a predetermined product (fixed scope) even if time/cost increases, while Agile aims to deliver the most valuable product (flexible scope) within set time and resource limits.</p>

            question: "Explain the four core values of the Agile Manifesto and their significance.",
            answer: `
                <p>The Agile Manifesto lists four core values, stating preference for the items on the left (Based on PDF slide 9):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:</strong> Values human collaboration and communication over rigid adherence to processes or reliance on specific tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working software over comprehensive documentation:</strong> Prioritizes delivering functional software as the primary measure of progress, reducing reliance on extensive upfront or detailed documentation. (Based on "Working Product" in PDF slide 9)</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:</strong> Emphasizes continuous engagement and partnership with the customer to ensure the product meets evolving needs, rather than sticking strictly to a predefined contract.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responding to change over following a plan:</strong> Recognizes that requirements will change and builds processes to welcome and adapt to change, providing a competitive advantage.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These values represent a shift from traditional, plan-driven approaches by valuing people, tangible results, partnership, and adaptability higher.</p>

            question: "Describe the concepts of 'Iterative' and 'Incremental' development as applied in Agile.",
            answer: `
                <p>Iterative and Incremental are core concepts in Agile (Based on PDF slide 10):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Iterative Development:</strong> Involves repeating development cycles (iterations/sprints) through phases like planning, design, coding, and testing. Each cycle refines the product. (Based on PDF slides 7, 14)</li>
                    <li><strong>Incremental Development:</strong> Involves building and delivering the software in functional pieces (increments). Each iteration adds a new, working piece of functionality to the system built previously. (Based on PDF slides 7, 15)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Agile combines both: each iteration builds a new increment of working software, allowing for continuous refinement and early delivery of value.</p>

                <p>Three key Agile principles (Based on PDF slides 11-13):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software:</strong> Guides teams to prioritize delivering functional features frequently that provide actual business value to the customer. This ensures customer needs are met and value is realized early.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working software is the primary measure of progress:</strong> Directs teams and stakeholders to evaluate progress based on demonstrable, functional software rather than documentation or phase completion. This provides a realistic view of project status and ensures focus on the final product.</li>
                    <li><strong>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation:</strong> Encourages direct communication among team members to foster better understanding, quicker problem-solving, and stronger collaboration, especially when co-located.</li>

                    <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Fixed duration for iterations (1-6 weeks).</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive:</strong> Ability to easily adjust to changes or risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>People-oriented:</strong> Focus on individuals and their interactions.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Early Realization of Value:</strong> Due to incremental delivery, functional parts of the software are available to the customer sooner, providing business value earlier in the project lifecycle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Adaptability and Visibility:</strong> Frequent, incremental releases make the product visible early and continuously. This allows for early identification of issues and facilitates easier response to changing requirements throughout the project.</li>

            answer: `
                <p>The Waterfall Model is a sequential SDLC (PDF slide 5) with typical phases:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Requirement Gathering</li>
                    <li>System Analysis</li>

                <p>Its primary limitation is its <strong>resistance to change</strong> (PDF slides 5, 7). Because phases must be completed sequentially, incorporating changes once a phase is finished is difficult and costly, making it unsuitable for projects with evolving requirements.</p>
